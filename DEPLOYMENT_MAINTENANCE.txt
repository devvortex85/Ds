## Maintenance and Monitoring

### Updates
To update your application:
1. Pull the latest code from the repository
2. Activate the virtual environment
3. Update dependencies
4. Run migrations
5. Collect static files
6. Rebuild search index
7. Restart the Gunicorn service

### Database Backup
1. Create a backup script that uses pg_dump to export the database
2. Set up a cron job to run this script regularly (e.g., daily)

### Monitoring
Monitor application logs and performance through:
1. Gunicorn/Django logs via systemd journal
2. Nginx access and error logs
3. PostgreSQL logs

### Troubleshooting
Common issues and solutions:

1. **Application fails to start**: Check the Gunicorn service status
2. **Database connection issues**: Verify PostgreSQL is running correctly
3. **Static files not appearing**: Ensure static files are collected properly
4. **Permission issues**: Check file ownership and permissions
5. **SSL certificate errors**: Renew or troubleshoot SSL certificates
