# Backup Files

This directory contains files that were previously used in the application but have been consolidated or replaced with improved versions.

## Directory Structure

- `/archived` - Contains organized backup files by type
  - `/css` - Archived CSS files including introjs.min.css and user_guide.css
  - `/js` - Archived JavaScript files including adaptive-sizing.js, intro.min.js, and user-guide.js
  - `/html` - Archived HTML templates including base_updated.html

- `/templates` - Contains backup templates organized by functionality

## Purpose

These files are kept for reference purposes and potential future restoration if needed. 
The main application no longer references these files directly as their functionality has been:

1. Consolidated into unified files (e.g., script.js, unified-theme.css)
2. Replaced with improved implementations
3. Removed due to redundancy

## Notes

- The user guide functionality may be re-implemented in the future
- Adaptive sizing code has been merged into script.js
- Certain template structures were reorganized for better maintainability
